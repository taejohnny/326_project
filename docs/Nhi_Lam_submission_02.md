For this project submission, in the beginning I worked mainly with the models and admin pages. I started the template for both of the files, filling it with the models and attributes that were discussed during our mock data models we did in class. This was changed a lot of times during the way, and I assisted in the changes the the troubleshooting that occurred on these pages. I also made sure that the admin page was working correctly and had all of the attributes we needed. Lucas improved this even further towards the end, though!

In addition, I also worked a lot on the profile page to get the correct data for the reviews and the favorite classes through editing the views to get the context data, and I added the professors page to have different profiles for the professors, which showcases the classes they taught, with basically the same methods as the profile page.

Lastly, there was a lot of troubleshooting that I took part in with my team, and by troubleshooting I mean reasearch, and by research I mean Googling. We ran into problems with foreign keys and many-to-many fields regarding references and counts that we needed in order to organize the page or just make sure that it references the data it's supposed to; I mostly played the "support" role here and helped out with the troubleshooting required. For example, we needed to figure out the number of feedbacks a certain class was given in order to order the most popular classes correctly on the homepage.
