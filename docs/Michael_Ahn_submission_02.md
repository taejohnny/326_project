#Michael Ahn Write Up

During this phase I worked on several areas of my team's project. The first component that I contributed to was in the models.py file. Here along with Taesan Yoon we worked on creating the Feedback Model class as well as the following fields: comment, course, user, rating,  and date as well as the method _str_. 

Another part that I worked on was in the init.py. I worked on the for loops that generated artificial data for our Feedback model to use. Specifically, I created some of the user comments as well as ratings and worked on the indices that randomly connected them and saved them to the feedback model.

I also worked on the data model diagram. I created the diagram on draw.io and worked extensively on the design as well as updating the fields and methods as new fields and methods were added to the models.py.
