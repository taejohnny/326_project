For this submission, I primiarly worked on the user's ability to edit their profile details. This involved creating a form that would encompass all of the user and student model attributes, allowing them to modify any of these attributes that they wish. I also worked with others on the creation of the login/registration pages. I also spent some time modifying the templates to add consistency amoung all pages. 

Regardless of the number of hurdles that we encountered throughout this submission, I feel like we learned a great amount. One of the biggest problems I specifically encountered was figuring out how forms work, and spending hours trying to figure out why a HTTP POST request was not being sent, only to realize that attribute " action="" " was the reason why. I also realized that logging into the admin page as admin, admin overrides the current login of the entire application (I was filtering based on the current user without knowing I was logged in as admin).
