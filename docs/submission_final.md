Semester: Fall 2018
Overview: A brief overview of your application. This will be based on what you are submitting as your final web application artifact. You should also mention why your application is innovative.
Team Members: Lucas Phan, Thanh Pham, Nhi Lam, Richard Li, Taesan Yoon, Michael Ahn
User Interface: A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s user interface. This should include the name of the UI view and its purpose. You should include a screenshot of each of your UI views.
Data Model: A final up-to-date diagram of your data model including a brief description of each of the entities in your model and their relationships.
URL Routes/Mappings: A final up-to-date table of all the URL routes that your application supports and a short description of what those routes are used for. You should also indicate any authentication and permissions on those routes.
Authentication/Authorization: We have authentication for students only. Registration creates a User along with a Student (profile) which is a one-to-one model in relation to the User in order to add additional fields, basically extending the User model. The students, only once logged in, will be able to review classes (leave feedback and ratings). Users will only be able to access the edit profile for their own user profile page, not anyone else's. The user is also able to edit their password by going through the password reset form on the registration page. Only admins will be able to add classes and professors.
Team Choice: You should briefly mention your team choice component for your application. You should highlight any additions to your application that are part of your team choice, such as, URL routes, UI views, data model, to make it clear what your team choice addition is.
Conclusion: A conclusion describing your team’s experience in working on this project. This should include what you learned through the design and implementation process, the difficulties you encountered, what your team would have liked to know before starting the project that would have helped you later, and any other technical hurdles that your team encountered.
