I helped with the login.html page that would ultimately take in the username and password of a user. I updated the login template so that it would be simpler to understand, and that it would have still have the important form fields, buttons, and checks. I updated he urls.py and settings.py files to reflect the changes in the login view by adding the appropriate paths. 

I helped in implementing the logout redirection, as we initially thought it would be a good idea to redirect to the "edit profile" page of the user. Ultimately, we decided on redirecting to the main page. I also helped in the implementation of the logout functionality. Specifically I helped on the template where the user would be taken to a view and told that they are logged out, as well as given the option of logging in again.  

I helped in writing the team write up, including the design overview, problems/successes, and team choice. In the design overview, I helped in describing the authentication and authorization of the login functionality, as well as the implementation of forms. For the problems/successes and team choice, it was important to keep up on what the group was working, their issues, and their goals at all times.
