# Important Data

Please describe the important data that your application will be managing.

# User Interface

Below is a user's profile page on the website. While the class ratings are the center of the site, we thought it could be similar to a social media platform, and it's nice to have everything in one place for the user and others to refer to.

Provide a description and images of the user interface your
application will intend on supporting.

Here is the homepage. It will contain information about the current top classes, popular classes, featured class, and other eye-catching options.

The search results page will display a list of all the classes related to the search input. It will display all important information on the left, such as pre-reqs, gen-eds, etc.

The advanced search is similar to spire, but much more accessible and easier to read. It keeps important information while disregarding a lot of the pointless info on spire.
