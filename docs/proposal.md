# Innovative Idea

Spew is an innovative student-driven database centered around finding the perfect class for any student. It provides an array of information on any class offered at UMass, such as required textbooks, instructors, attendance and so on. It also allows students to share feedback in the form of reviews, along with ratings based on certain disciplines of the class. This application will allow students to view most-rated and highest-rated classes, along with the ability to view related classes in the form of track based on the student's concentration. 
# Important Data

Please describe the important data that your application will be managing.

# User Interface


Here is the homepage. It will contain information about the current top classes, popular classes, featured class, and other eye-catching options.

 The following is the class page, which displays general class information, along with classes that are relevant to the currently viewed class in the top right. Further down, reviews are submitted by students and ratings are also submitted based on specific disciplines of that class.

 The search results page will display a list of all the classes related to the search input. It will display all important information on the left, such as pre-reqs, gen-eds, etc.

 The advanced search is similar to spire, but much more accessible and easier to read. It keeps important information while disregarding a lot of the pointless info on spire.
