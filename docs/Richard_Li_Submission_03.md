I helped in the team write up portion. I contributed in figuring out the problems and success of this submission. I also helped in forming the design overview.
I helped in finding some minor fixes in urls.py and bugs in the html, specifically the overlapping titles we originally had. I fixed these bugs, but Lucas did the pushing.
