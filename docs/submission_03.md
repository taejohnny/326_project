Spew

# OVERVIEW
Spew is an innovative student-driven database centered around finding the perfect class for any student. It provides an array of information on any class offered at UMass, such as required textbooks, instructors, attendance and so on. It also allows students to share feedback in the form of reviews, along with ratings based on certain disciplines of the class. This application will allow students to view most-rated and highest-rated classes, along with the ability to view related classes in the form of track based on the student's concentration. There has been no changes to our design proposal since the previous project submission.

# DESIGN OVERVIEW

 
# SUCCESSES
* We have had success in creating an HTML template for each of our class pages and extending the base template
* We have had success in implementing Django in our design using views, templates, and urls
* We have had success in creating models that are all related to one another, and implementing them in a way that is most       organized and efficient 
* We have had success in creating submission deadlines and staying consistent with them
# PROBLEMS
* Since many of us have not used GitHub to a great extent, we have had issues in the organization and of files and folders in the    project repo
* We have had issues in our ability to communicate as effectively
* We have had issues in finding time where everyone could meet and work together (scheduling conflicts)
* We have had multiple issues with the database and migrations 
* We have had issues computing and displaying the average ratings for a class because the average rating is computed via         multiple feedback objects
