I contributed in several ways to this phase of our project,spew. Most contributions occured through initializing and implementing the login/logout feature into our design. I made changes to the urls.py and settings.py folder in order to add django site authentication. The changes to urls.py automatically mapped urls connected to login and logout. I also helped push changes to the settings.py file in order to allow for correct pathing in our website. 
For the login page, I helped implement the buttons and input fields. I also helped to link the login url from the current sign in button as well as reformat the design of the upper task bar in order to provide a more streamline experience utilizing the login page. Lastly, I helped implement the logout feature and creating the sign out button. 
Lastly, I helped to write the team writeup. I created the document and pushed the template to the github. I contributed specifically to the overview, design overview as well as reflecting with the group on our problems and successes.
