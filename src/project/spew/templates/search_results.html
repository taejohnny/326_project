                    <h4>INSTRUCTOR(S): Timothy Richards</h4>
                    <p>The World Wide Web was proposed originally as a collection of static documents inter-connected
                        by hyperlinks.
                        Today, the web has grown into a rich platform, built on a variety of protocols, standards, and
                        programming languages, that aims to replace many of the services traditionally provided by a
                        desktop operating system.
                        Topics will include: producing dynamic content using a server-based language, content serving
                        databases and XML documents, session state management, multi-tier web-based architectures, web
                        security, and core technologies
                        including HTTP, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL will be emphasized.
                        This course will also study concepts and technologies including AJAX, social networking,
                        mashups, JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery), and web security.
                        This course is hands-on and project-based; students will construct a substantial dynamic web
                        application based on the concepts, technologies, and techniques presented during lecture.
                        This course satisfies the IE Requirement.</p>

                    <h4>INSTRUCTOR(S): DEEPAK GANESAN, JEREMY GUMMESON</h4>
                    <p>In this course we examine the important problems in Usability, Human Computer Interaction, User
                        Interfaces and Human Centered Computing.
                        We will examine elements of HCI history, human information processing capabilities, HCI design,
                        user interface prototyping methods and new applications and directions in HCI,
                        including affective HCI. This is not a course on how to make better dialog boxes, but rather a
                        much more thorough exploration of how humans interact with computers and how to evaluate the
                        effectiveness of HCI designs.
                        Some elementary programming, or the use of UI prototyping tools, will be required, but students
                        without prior programming experience should feel right at home in this class.
                        The course is available to any undergraduate student and is not limited to computer scientists.
                        IT-minor students are especially encouraged to participate. The course emphasizes group
                        projects and students will be required to work in teams.
                        There is one midterm exam, numerous class presentations of on-going project work, and a final
                        demo and presentation of the major class project.
                        The course will be taught in a mixed format, with both on-line and regular classroom
                        components. Lectures wlll be on-line, and weekly discussion groups and studios will be
                        conducted in regular classroom settings.
                        Attendance of some of the studio classes will be required, and there will be several project
                        presentations throughout the semester.
                        Students will be encouraged to use the available class time to work on their team projects. No
                        prerequisites but Junior/Senior standing required. 3 credits.</p>

                    <h4>INSTRUCTOR(S): ALEXANDRA MELIOU</h4>
                    <p>In recent years, the ability to continuously monitor activities, health, and lifestyles of
                        individuals using sensor technologies has reached unprecedented levels.
                        The typical smartphone comes equipped with a plethora of sensors for monitoring activity,
                        speech patterns, social interactions, and location.
                        In addition, mobile accessories such as wearable wristbands and chestbands now enable routine
                        and continuous monitoring of a host of physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, respiratory
                        rate, skin Conductance, and others.).
                        In conjunction, these sensors can enable higher-order inferences about more complex human
                        activities/behavioral states (e.g., activity patterns, stress, sleep, etc.).
                        Such ubiquitous sensing in daily life, referred to as mobile health sensing and monitoring,
                        promises to revolutionize our understanding of human activities and health conditions.
                        This course is an introduction to personal health sensing and monitoring through mobile phones
                        and on-body sensors and addresses several aspects
                        including mobile devices and applications for health, sensor data quality and reliability
                        challenges, inference of key health assessments from
                        sensor data including such as activity patterns, sleep patterns, or stress, sensor data
                        visualization and feedback, and practical considerations such as battery lifetime.
                        This course counts as a CS Elective toward the CS major (BA/BS).</p>
